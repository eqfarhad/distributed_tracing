Distributed Tracing Implementation

# Welcome to Distributed Tracing POC!

This repository contains a sample app scenario that preview how we can implement tracing. Here, we are using OpenTelemetry api/sdk to instrument our code and using Jaeger as backend of our traces.


We can then access the Jaeger UI through this link:
http://localhost:16686/search
## Structure 
In this scenario we have 3 main module, Main server, Formatter, Queryyer*;

 1. Main Server is our first endpoint which listens to `http://localhost:8080/sayHello/` and we can pass any name as a parameter to this api like for example: 
   `http://localhost:8080/sayHello/trace`.
   
 2. Queryyer is the second end point which our main server will call after receiving a request. The main task of Queryyer is to query the database and return the information related to the person name, if exist. The name of Queryyer is based on Formatter :).

3. The third service is Formatter which again will be called by the main server, and basically it put the retrieved information from the queryyer into a specific format; title-name-description.

We have also two other folders, Lib and Client:
Lib: contains general Initialiser for OpenTelemetry with Jaeger endpoint
Client: by running the client main.go we are simulating one single request to the server, this is equivalent of running the command, `curl http://localhost:8080/sayHello/trace`
